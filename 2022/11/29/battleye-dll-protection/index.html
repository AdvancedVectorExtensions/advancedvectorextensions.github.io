<p>The anti-cheat software BattlEye, considered the gold standard, has a catastrophic weakness that makes it easy for an attacker to insert code into the game&rsquo;s address space.</p>
<p>Dll injection is a well-known idea, but because of the numerous anti-cheat techniques used, attackers have resorted to manually mapping their modules into the game&rsquo;s address space in order to get beyond the checks employed.</p>
<h3 id="load-image-callback">Load Image Callback</h3>
<p>Several separate callbacks will initially be registered by the BattlEye driver when it is loaded into the kernel. In this article, the file-system and image load callbacks are the callbacks that are under discussion.</p>
<p>A dll will initially be delivered to the image load callback for initial verification when it is injected into a game that is BattlEye protected. The callback will start by allocating a pool of memory to keep details about the dll.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The callback also handles the verification of kernel images in a similar fashion.  This will not be discussed in this article.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following allocation and verification of the pool, the callback will start copying the image name to <code>Pool+0xC</code> after filling the memory with zeros.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DfH0ex9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After the image&rsquo;s name is copied to the allocation, the function will begin writing other crucial information such as the image&rsquo;s base and size.</p>

<p>Once the load image callback has concluded, it will submit the data to BEService to start the certification verification process. When it determines if a dll is legitimate or malicious, BEService will alert BEDaisy&rsquo;s file-system callback.</p>
<h3 id="filesystem-callback">FileSystem Callback</h3>
<p>To avoid interfering with other processes, the file-system callback will start by making sure the caller process is the BattlEye protected game.</p>

<p>It will further guarantee that the picture being judged is a PE binary.</p>

<p>It will start copying the relevant information.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1ZL5gMY.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now it will iterate a collection of dll&rsquo;s and determinate the one being verified.</p>

<p>If the verification steps were successful, the dll will be recognised as trustworthy and will not be prevented from loading.</p>

<h3 id="defeating">Defeating</h3>
<p>To mitigate this from usermode, one can simply hook the file reading functions (CreateFile) that BattlEye uses for certificate verification in usermode and employ a signed file that is accepted by BattlEye.</p>
<p>If this route is taken, one must also thwart the integrity checks employed using NtReadVirtualMemory as well as when BattlEye reports crucial dll information.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Complete dll injection is now achieved.</p>
